I have to say I am impressed.These have really great sound!  I got these to use in place of some noise canceling headphones I have from Sony as they hurt my head after a while, and these are really great!  They sound very rich, and they are incredibly compact and easy to throw in a bag and take with you.  That being said, I think they could get pretty tangled up easily, so I am careful to not put them anywhere without wrapping them neatly first.  But if that doesn\u0027t bother you, these headphones are an incredible, rumbly bassy bang for your buck.",

They have three different sized \"buds\" so you can choose the right size for your ear.  I have to use the large size even though I have small ears to get good sound quality.

I have bought many of Panasonic\u0027s cheaper products including VCR, blu-ray player, rice cooker, and some of their on-ear headphones; they all exceed my expectations for the value.

    "reviewText": "I bought these headphones for one reason, value.People in my family have a habit of destroying ear buds--cheap and expensive alike. Typically they were lasting 1-4 months. I didn\u0027t want to sacrifice audio quality, but with that track record I wasn\u0027t ready to spend $30 or even $15 on a pair. With that in mind, I decided to find the best value sub $10 headphones I could find. It was between this model and another brand, which I wont name here, and I happy that I selected this one.If you want a cheap ear bud with great passive noise reduction, this is a great option. They seal they create allows for great audio range that greatly exceeds Apple\u0027s ear buds and blocks ambient noise.I bought these and designated them to be only for our iPad, which kept them out of my son\u0027s backpack and my wife\u0027s purse. They are still going, and are in great shape.The value in these is so great that I don\u0027t see any advantage in spending more money on ear buds, unless you are ready to spend over $100 for an entry level audiophile product. Even if there are some $40+ pairs out there that might be a little better (and there are many that are much worse), the quality you would gain for the $30+ is pretty insignificant until you start paying $$$ for very high signal to noise ratio--which is a measure of how \u0026#34;clean\u0026#34; the sound is.",

I also have a pair of awesome, Philips earbud phones of which one set I keep in my motorcycle for listening to NPR or music while riding  case and another in my backpack for general travel use.I wanted to get an inexpensive pair for me and my wife when we are riding our bicycles or walking the neighborhood for exercise. If they were to get lost or damaged, I wouldn\u0027t be heart-broken. These produce a pretty good range of sound.

They can\u0027t capture the full range and deep bass of my full-size Sony headphone, but these are less than 1/5 the cost of those.

One thing I will note is how well they fit your ear - they employ a curved design to fit well inside your ear and I\u0027ve never had issues with them falling out like other earbuds. My only other complaint is that they don\u0027t have a clamp/\"zipper\" to bind the two separate cords when not in usage, and as a result they get somewhat tangled every time I put them away.But I really haven\u0027t found any better for the price, if you\u0027re willing to spend double digits then you might find some with better bass but other than that I thoroughly recommend them.",

The sound is reasonable, not the best I\u0027ve heard from cheap earbuds, but I\u0027m most unhappy with them insofar as the amount of external sound they let in; perhaps they just don\u0027t fit my ear well, but--well, I guess they don\u0027t.  I\u0027ve bought cheap JVC earbuds that I liked a lot more than these.I won\u0027t buy these again when the die or get lost.UPDATE Mar 2, 2014:  I\u0027ve had more time to use these earbuds and have modified my opinion of them.  The sound from them seems, to me, to be essentially flat, with no real emphasis on any part of the audio spectrum, which is desirable (for quality sound), or perhaps with a slight boost at the extremes, the bass and treble (perhaps a de-emphasis of the mid range).  The bass is not muddy, the mid\u0027s not overpowering (as mid\u0027s tend to be in cheap, crummy, earbuds), and the highs are also clean and detailed (keep in mind this is compared to other earbuds I\u0027ve used, *not* high-end speaker systems and headphones!)  But these fine tonal qualities only present themselves in a quite place.As such, my original complaint stands, insofar as too much outside sound allowed in.  Someone had mentioned that this is due to poor-fitting, but, sorry, that\u0027s not the case.  These are great earbuds in a quite environ, but not nearly as good, or useful, in a normal-noise or loud area, i.e., an airplane or some workplaces, like mine.",

(There\u0027s something so soothing about being read to sleep!) and these are wonderful. They fit great. They sound even better. I usually go through a pair every few months because I buy the cheapos from wal-mart or best buy and because I mostly use them for audiobooks sound quality isn\u0027t a huge deal breaker. These are the best I\u0027ve encountered and if you factor in how downright NICE the price is? Amazing. They\u0027re wonderful. I wish I\u0027d bought more than one pair at a time!Disclaimer: I\u0027m no audiophile. The difference between \"horrific\" and \"okay\" sound is noticable but the difference between \"okay\" and \"super flippin nice\" is not to my ears. So, if you are one of those people who notice such things, I\u0027m no help. But if you\u0027re an average book/music listener looking for nice sounding, cheap costing, and well fitting earbuds?

Nontheless I turned my mp3 palyer on a moderate volume level and walked away. About 8 or so hours later I checked them and the sound was really good. I\u0027m going to keep burning them in for about another 10-15 hours and start using them.

Tried using an old, bulky pair of Aiwa Noise Cancelling on ear headphones and the sound wasn\u0027t as good, the active noise cancelling worked, but earbuds are nearly as effective.  I don\u0027t remember the model number of my Sennheiser, but they sounded great and I had them for a few years. They were $50 new, so they weren\u0027t inexpensive. After reading many favorable reviews here and deciding I didn\u0027t really want to spend $50 again, I bought these.I am not disappointed. They don\u0027t sound as good as the Sennheisers, they aren\u0027t nearly as crisp in detail and a bit muddy, especially on older recordings played on an iPod Touch 1G. But for under $10, they are fine and are probably much better than the no-name earbuds I was considering from a discount store. I\u0027ve always had good luck with Panasonic brand items.True audiophiles will want to look elsewhere, but if you need decent sound for a  price that won\u0027t cause you to worry about losing them or breaking them, these are for you. I found them comfortable to wear, personally, on the smallest earpiece.",

Usually headphones only last me about a year before something goes wrong. One side goes out or the cable needs to be help a certain way for the sound to work. I have had 3 different DRE beats headphones and many other skullycandy, sony, and you name it brands that have all last less than a year.These have laster me over 2 years and the only reason I\u0027m replacing them is because i dropped them outside my house on the street. My girlfriend found them later that day and they had some damage, as if a car ran over one and the sound was a bit low on that side. Amazingly they still work but I\u0027m replacing them because I really don\u0027t expect them to last too long with that damage. I wouldn\u0027t recommend anyone run over their headphones but WOW can\u0027t believe how good the build quality is.The only thing I don\u0027t like is that it has no volume control on the wire. I would gladly pay a little more for a future model that includes this. If you go through headphones like I do then look no further. THESE ARE FOR YOU!",

The best compliment I can pay these is to say that at least it did not cost me that much money to be disappointed. Uncomfortable (of course, I find most in-ear headphones uncomfortable until I replace the cheapo silicone cushions with foam), and with poor (IMHO) sound quality. I am older, and my hearing is not what it used to be, but... I did expect that these -in-ear headphones would provide adequate amplification. They did not, and the sound they did produce was what I could only describe as tinny.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased these after a positive review by a cnet editor, who claimed they are cheap and deliver good sound. But alas...These headphones are a last resort, in-the-pinch sort. I won\u0027t give them one star since they work (i.e. deliver sound). But the sound is very tinny and distorts very easily if the music volume is at or above street-listening level (as opposed to library-listening level), as well as if your EQ is set to deliver any small amount of bass. Another thing I didn\u0027t like: when you move your head while wearing these, or if the very thin cords move against your clothing (e.g. walking or jogging), the cord rattling sound is very loudly transferred to your ears; so much so that it was very distracting.I\u0027m not picky about style so the minimalist design of these Panasonics suits me fine. Another plus for me is that the cord splits and two equal lengths lead to each ear piece, as opposed to a short cord for one side and a longer cord for the other side after the split. But these are very minor pluses. This Panasonic line offers great selection in colors and unbeatable prices. The set comes with three sizes of comfortable ear fittings.Despite the few redemptive qualities, these headphones lack what I consider the most important attribute of any headphones; good sound quality.",

    "reviewText": "I think my opinion on these headphones are about a mixture of the Most Helpful Favorable and Critical Review. On one side of the fence these things are pretty darn good for a pair that costs \u0026#60;$10 and as somebody who isn\u0027t an audiophile I am very happy with the quality that I get from a pair of in-ear headphones that I won\u0027t have to protect like a price Jewel. The bass in these things will leave you shocked by how great they sound in your ear. Now with that being said, I have a pair of $30 Over the Ear Seinheisers that blow these out of the water so the point should be made that if you trying to get quality with a strict budget, you may want to look elsewhere and spend just a bit more money.",

They certainly have good, accurate treble, and *maybe* at a volume high enough to damage your ears they would have good bass (I wouldn\u0027t know), but they don\u0027t meet my requirement for a good workout earbud with a strong (but accurate) bass. I own the Thinksound ts01 and the V-MODA Vibe and both of these buds have a much superior bass even at a moderate volume. I paid a lot more for them than the current price here on Amazon (as of today) too.",
